- *What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS?*

Doing pull requests and merging on github.

- *What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
 
 Merge conflicts, also pull requests and merging on github.

 - *What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*

Asked guide about why git says "Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'" when I knew I was a commit behind the master on github. 

- *What still confuses you about Git?*

Right now, nothing seems confusing, though I could probably use more practice with merge conflicts.

- *How was your first experience pairing in a GPS?*

Fine? Pretty much what I expected.
